# Social-Network-Analysis-in-Swiss-Politics
Semester Project of HSLU MSc in Applied Information and Data Science course: Analysis and Modelling of Social Interactions


# Introduction
The ojective of this repository is to create an overview about the semester project. The objective of the project itself is to answer the following research questions: Is a councillor in the Swiss “Nationalrat” with a favorable position in its own party more likely to be re-elected for a new period regardless its party’s political orientation? 

This question was answered proceeding the following steps: 
1. Data Preparation
2. Calculate the Closeness Centrality (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/closeness-centrality-centrality-measure/)
3. Calculate the Perason Correlation Coefficient (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pearson-correlation-coefficient/?ref=gcse) and proceed a T-Test (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/t-test/?ref=gcse) to determine relationsships between the centrality of a councillor within its party (SVP, CVP, SP) or within the right- or left-winged parties, and their succes in the elections for the new period. 
4. Evaluate significance of the results of the Correlation Analysis and T-Tests
